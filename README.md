# Summary

<p>
This is a use case for Plotly Dash.<br>
It creates a sales dashboard for world wide e-commerce data.<br>
According to Wordnik a dashboard is <br>
"a user interface on a computer display that presents constantly updated information, such as processing speed, in a format that resembles the dashboard of a vehicle."<br>
This sales dashboard is intuitively understandable.

<p>
On a technical level this project applies Plotly and JupyterDash for data visualization and web deployment.<br>
It is also applying HTML and CSS to structure and style the dashboard.

<p>
This notebook is part of larger project consisting of a portfolio of notebooks testing out different versions of the sales dashboard.<br>
There is also a dedicated notebook for importing and cleaning the data.<br>
The cleaned data can immediately used in the JupyterDash notebooks.<br>
It is followed up by another project adding interactivity to the sales dashboard.<br>
Then users can get particular information by sliding or klicking on graphic elements.<br>

<p>
Dash made a great job bringing Dash to Jupyter.<br>
Normally you would develop and start Dash from an IDE and the command line.<br>
As this project is a demonstration of Dash capabilities JupyterDash was chosen.<br>
The Dash app is here displayed inside the notebook, but there are other notebook versions, which starts the app with link at the end of the output into a website.<br>
One last word: <b>Dash needs Javascript to be installed on the machine to work.</b>
